    <h3>My Programming Journey</h3>
    <p>I remember it well, I was a a sales representative at State Farm where I was making pretty good money as an insurance sales person.
      One day State Farm management called all of the sales representatives into the office and told us that our commisson checks were being cut. 
      This led me to look around at my other options in the company and a friend of mine from game night showed me Codecademy.com where I took the HTML CSS and Javascript course and than I took the Nucamp BackEnd Course.
      This gave me the exposure that I needed to study things like AWS, Python, and Django. Currently I have been working in Udemy with Brad Traversy and Mosh to learn Javascript and C#.

      I started learning to program back in 2022 when I was looking for another
      department to serve State Farm in. My friend showed me Codecademy and I
      always thought I was good with computers. After a few courses I decided to
      enroll in Nucamps coding bootcamp. Since than I have been practicing in
      python, <span style="color:orange">HTML,</span> <span style="color: blue;">CSS</span>, <span style="color:navy">JavaScript, </span><span style="color:green">Django,</span> and <span style="color:purple" Programming is wonderful>C#</span>
      because you can build amazing things, work in teams, and being a nerd I
      delight in working with fellow nerds!
